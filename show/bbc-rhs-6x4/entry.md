Local BBC radio and RHS design a garden competition
===================================================

[BBC Radio Lancashire](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radiolancashire "https://www.bbc.co.uk/radiolancashire"), [BBC Radio Manchester](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radiomanchester "https://www.bbc.co.uk/radiomanchester") and [BBC Radio Merseyside](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radiomerseyside "https://www.bbc.co.uk/radiomerseyside") are joining forces with the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) to run an exciting garden design competition.

We are looking for three planet friendly garden designs to be brought to life at [RHS Tatton Flower Show](https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-flower-show-tatton-park "https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-flower-show-tatton-park") in 2022,

Our theme this year is ‘**Planet Friendly Gardens**’, taking inspiration from where you live.

Your design can be created digitally, or by hand and must be submitted by post – the key element is that your ideas are clear to the selection panel (which will include RHS and BBC representatives).

What are the judges looking for?
--------------------------------

The entries will be selected by a judging panel (to include RHS and BBC representatives) using the following criteria:

*   Originality and innovation.
*   How well the garden interprets the brief.
*   How interesting and creative the design is.
*   The creative and effective use of plants.

Our aim is to inspire our show visitors with great take home ideas and demonstrate how creative you can be when designing for a small outside space, set within a local theme.

We’ll need your entries by Monday 14 February 2022. Three designs will be chosen – one from each region.

The winning designers will be given the opportunity to work with a professional mentor and landscape contractor to bring your design to life at the RHS Tatton Flower Show, 20 - 24 July 2022.

How to enter
------------

This is a competition to design a ‘Planet Friendly Garden’ taking inspiration from your local area, and thinking of creative ways of designing to get the most out of a small outdoor space.

‘Planet Friendly Garden’ is based on a 6m (depth) x 4m (frontage) flat site. Any excavations should be no deeper than 1 metre.

Top tips

**Things to consider when designing your garden:**

*   Landscaping materials (not to be commercially recognisable)
*   Details of structures included (not to be commercially recognisable)
*   Furniture/accessories to be featured (not to be commercially recognisable)
*   Details of any excavations (e.g. pond) – i.e. will the spoil be incorporated into the garden or need to be removed?
*   You should not include public access to your garden.
*   The perimeter of you garden needs to be considered in your design i.e. fencing, hedging, walls etc.
*   'City Gardens’ are 6 x 4m = 24 sq m. They will be viewed from the front and side and therefore must include boundaries on two sides, (back and left hand side) The side boundary should be a maximum height of 2m, except at the front of the garden where they should be a maximum height of 1.2m for the first 2.4m.
*   Gardens will be laid out [as shown in image 1 of the Design Brief](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/england/pdf/local-bbc-radio-and-rhs-garden-design-competition-terms-and-conditions-2022.pdf "http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/england/pdf/local-bbc-radio-and-rhs-garden-design-competition-terms-and-conditions-2022.pdf"), with a gap of 3m between each garden boundary, allowing visitors to walk freely around the gardens.
